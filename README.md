Change in fluorescence over time in mice with 3 different types of injuries (conditions) are measured: sham 
surgery (control), crush injury (more severe), cut injury (most severe). Measurements are taken in 3 time 
points: 2 days (acute stage), 10 days (regenerative stage), 60 days (healed stage). Change in fluorescence 
is measured with an examination of neurons and obtaining five different measurements: Rise Time, Peak 
Amplitude, Slope, DT1, DT2. Analysis for rise time is included in this report. Other measurements can be 
analyzed in the same manner.
